## FAQ  

#### Where can I find more DLLs?

> The most reputable source to look for more DLLs is [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/search.php?searchid=18371288)

#### Where can I find more Scripts?

> The most reputable source to look for more Scripts is [V3rMillion](https://v3rmillion.net/)

#### Hevo wont open when I run it!

 > You most likely left your antivirus enabled, or forgot to configure it to ignore HevoEX. If you don't have a third-party antivirus installed, read the section below on how to disable Windows Virus and Threat Protection. 

#### Why does HevoEX need Administrator Permissions?
 > Since Hevo has an on-board internal DLL injector, it needs to reference System files in order to work (`kernel32.dll` respectively). Without requiring admin permissions the DLL injector would simply break

#### Why does HevoEX flag as a virus?

> Due to the nature of Roblox exploits and the way they work (game manipulation, raw code injection, etc.) you need to disable Windows Security if on Windows 10 Home or Pro, and Windows Defender if on Windows 10 Enterprise and above, and if you have another antivirus software installed configure it to allow all files within the HevoEX directory ( Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\HevoEX\` ). Hevo is not a virus, and will not work with an unconfigured antivirus enabled, since it will automatically remove important files required for the application to launch. You can learn how to turn off Windows Defender [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJb9CuVAHMI). HevoEX uses a process called code injection to attach itself to a game. This process is also being used by some malicious software, which is why your antivirus tool may detects this download as malicious.

HevoEX is 100% safe to use, as long as you got it from here!
